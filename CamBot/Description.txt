General implimentation;

# OVERVIEW:
Use a Browser-Based DOM Scraper (Low-Code, I Can Help Set It Up)
If you want to automate chat monitoring, this is the most advanced long-term method.

🔹 Tools:
Tampermonkey (browser script manager)
Custom script that scrapes the chat divs in each tab
Sends chat text to ChatGPT API via webhook or bot
Returns suggestions in a discord channel

💬 Example Flow:
You run a script that scrapes each tab’s last 5 messages every minute
Messages get sent to GPT via webhook or local app
GPT returns: "Say this", "They're hinting at JOI", "Push countdown"
Displayed on your second screen or OBS overlay

✅ Fully automatic after setup
⚠️ Requires installing scripts

***---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***
steps🔧 

1. download Tampermonkey
2. get python script and paste it into Tampermonkey
3. get an api key from openrouter and add it to the script in tampermonkey 
4. create a private discord server and channel and get the webhook for the channel
5. add webhook and api key to script in tampermoneky (see example)

DEBUGGING/TESTING
1. enter an active models room
2. open consol
    On the model page, right-click anywhere → Inspect
    Go to the Console tab (top of the dev tools window)
3. paste this in consol to test that the chatbot works -> document.querySelector('.chat-box') || document.querySelector('.chat-container') || document.querySelector('[data-room="chat"]')
    - does it say that the bot is watching the chat?
4. I spent time looking for where the website stores the live chat with the help of ai, eventually i did find it for cb and mfc but i couldn't find it for sm
5. the entire process is in the ai-chat but the chat is really long. if you know someone tech savvy they may be able to understand this and explain it better than i can
